2. In the ssh session, do a `wget <paste the copied url from GitHub here>`

Downloading specific files or folders 

Github only supports downloading the whole repo from its root. 
If you want to download a specific file or folder, here are some alternatives. 

- You can use a tool like Git or SVN to checkout only a folder of file locally. (You would have to install SVN or Git). 
- You can use a browser page like [DownGit](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home) to download it. See instructions below, for DownGit. 
- We are also providing Lab files as a ZIP archive at the module level. See instructions below.

DownGit Download Instructions

1 Navigate to the file or folder you want to download, and copy its URL from the browser URL bar
2 From [DownGit](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home), paste the URL unto the textbox
3 You have 2 options: 
  * You can download the file directly to your computer
  *	You can create a "download link" 

**If you are ssh'd remotely into a training AWS instance, the "download link" does not work. You need to download the ZIP locally and then move it to the AWS instance via scp.**
